### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance senior software developer mainly interested in frontend development. I have my [own company, Code ADN](http://codeadn.io), under which I do development conracts, but also photo shoots for local businesses.

âš¡ I'm a lifelong pianist ðŸŽ¹ and proud owner of an amazing & beautiful 2020 [Mason & Hamlin Model 50](http://masonhamlin.com/pianos/mason-hamlin/model-50/) upgright piano. I'm also a long-time guitarist ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤˜. I love a lot of musical styles, but mainly classical, extreme metal, blues and I can have some eastern European music at some moments.

I'm also an amateur photographer. I seek amazing landscapes and I love organizing car photo shoots. Follow me on Instagram [@nic.laplante](https://www.instagram.com/nic.laplante/) [@codeadn](https://www.instagram.com/codeadn/).

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at developing amazing frontend apps for [Discovery Inc.](https://www.discovery.com/).

I maintained two projects over time here on GitHub:
- [Angular Google Maps](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/), now part of [Angular UI](https://angular-ui.github.io)
- [Envelope](https://github.com/nlaplante/envelope), a budget management app for the Gnome Desktop written in Vala (now archived)
